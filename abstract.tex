As part of the \emph{Ad hoc sensor network} course, in this work we analyse and
comment \emph{Kimera-Multi} a multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping
system able to generate a dense metric-semantic mesh in a fully distributed
fashion. The sensor network presented in this paper is composed of expensive
and complex nodes, unlike the canonical problems presented during the course
lectures. Nevertheless they face similar challenges, such as communication
limitations and resilience to node failures.
